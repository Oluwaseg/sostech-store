## Implementation Notes

### Redis Considerations

- Current MVP uses synchronous email sending to avoid Redis free tier limitations
- Redis will be added for caching and queues when moving to paid infrastructure
- Consider Redis Cloud or AWS ElastiCache for production

### Database Scaling

- MongoDB Atlas for production database
- Consider read replicas for heavy read operations
- Implement database sharding strategy for multi-tenant growth

### Security First

- All new features must include security reviews
- Implement OWASP security practices
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all new services
- Integration tests for critical user flows
- E2E tests for complete checkout process
- Performance testing for high-traffic scenarios
